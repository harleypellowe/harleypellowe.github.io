    Hi! My name is Harley. I'm the creator of Suite Knowledge, a place where
    small business owners, freelancers, and productivity enthusiasts can learn
    how to get the most value out of their Google Suite products.
  </p>
  <p>
    Running a small business, freelance gig, or side hustle can require an
    upfront investment in tools you need to run your business. It's often
    tempting to subscribe to fancy services that claim to do something really
    well. Before you know it, those little subscriptions have added up. What if
    you could build those tools using just a Basic GSuite plan? Or, in some
    cases, your free personal Google account?
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some of the types of content you'll find on Suite Knowledge:
  </p>

  <h3>Projects</h3>
  <p>
    I write fun projects that demonstrate how useful tools (and even games!) can be built in Google Suite. The website is just getting started, but here are some of the projects I have in the pipeline:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a functional CRM;</li>
    <li>a Gantt chart for project management;</li>
    <li>and an extensible API backed by Google Sheets.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Projects walk you through every step, every mouse click, every line of code,
    so when you're done you have your own finished, working, useful tool!
  </p>
  <p>
    And even if you don't think you'll have a use for these projects, they
    are a fun way for you to build your Suite skills and will open your eyes to
    what's possible with Google Suite.
  </p>

  <h3>Ultimate Guides</h3>
  <p>
    I'll also be publishing a series of Ultimate Guides. Each guide will attempt
    to build the ultimate something, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Ultimate Kanban Board</li>
    <li>The Ultimate Time Tracker</li>
    <li>The Ultimate Bullet Journal</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You may have seen tutorials for these elsewhere online, but I find they
    usually do the bare minimum to get the job done, which goes against one
    of the core principles of Suite Knowledge: to push GSuite to its limits and
    explore unconventional uses for it. Hence why I'm calling these Ultimate
    Guides.
  </p>

  <h3>How-To's</h3>
  <p>
    These will be short blog posts that explain how to do some specific task.
  </p>

  <h3>Ebooks</h3>
  <p>
    I also have at least one ebook in the works. Ebooks will be available
    exclusively to patrons.
  </p>

  <h3>Online Community</h3>
  <p>
    My hope is to get enough traction here to justify setting up a Discourse
    server exclusively for patrons. You'll be able to access exclusive
    content, like ebooks and links to finished projects you can copy to your
    own GSuite account, and more.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's the thing: I won't be able to do this without you. I've setup the
    website on a shoestring budget, but it still requires money to run, and a
    lot of time to write content that will actually help you. Would you consider
    supporting Suite Knowledge? Even $1/month would be meaningful and would tell
    me that there are people who find this content valuable.
  </p>

    Join the Suite Knowledge community and help me help small business owners,
    freelancers, side hustlers, and productivity hackers like you!
