This is Part 4 of the Codenames tutorial series. In this part, we're going to write the actual code that will control our game, including choosing our words, randomly assigning colors to the board, and revealing colors when a team makes a guess.

* [Part 5 - Connecting UI elements to functions]({% post_url /codenames/2020-01-13-part-5 %})

Great! Now we have our sheets set up, we just have to add the logic. To do this we’ll create an Apps Script.

From the **Tools** menu choose **Script Editor**. Delete the default code there and enter the following.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function newBoard() {
  // Get references to the player and codemaster boards.
  var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var codemaster_range = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('codemaster_board');
  var player_range = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('player_board');
}
{% endhighlight %}

This code accesses two of our named ranges. Notice how easy the code is to read because of our appropriate variable names, the named ranges, and the clearly named built-in function **getRangeByName**.

Next, we need to choose 25 words from the word list. Instead of making one huge function, let’s make this specialized behavior a separate function of its own.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function getWords(spreadsheet) {
  // Get a reference to the word list.
  var words = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('word_list').getValues();
  
  var selected_words = [];
  for (i=0; i<25; i++) {
    // Choose a random word from the word list.
    var idx = getRandomInt(words.length);
    selected_words.push(words.splice(idx, 1)[0]);
  }
  return selected_words;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Once again we get the word list by referring to its named range. Then we execute a loop 25 times. Each time through, we pick a number using the current size of the word list as the maximum number. Then we remove the word from the word list using **splice()** and add it to the list of selected words using **push()**. Removing the word from the word list ensure we won’t have the same word appearing multiple times on the board.

Note that we’re not editing the actual spreadsheet. All of the words will remain there. We’re basically copying the word list into a variable and editing that variable. Then we return the 25 words to whatever code called this function.

A quick word about **getRandomInt**. This is not a built-in function; it’s one we’re going to build ourselves.

We actually need to create two functions: one to generate a random integer, the other to shuffle the elements of an array (which we’ll use later).

{% include message.html type="info" title="Reusable code" content="These functions are generic, meaning their purpose is not specific to the Codenames game. We may want to reuse them in other scripts in the future. I like to put functions like this in a separate code file so that they’re easy to find and copy. This way my <b>Code.gs</b> file only contains code relevant to the specific project I’m working on." %}

In the Script Editor, go to **File → New → Script** file. Name it `utilities`. Enter the following code and save.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function getRandomInt(max) {
  // Return a random integer between 0 and `max`.
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
}

function shuffle(a) {
  // Shuffle the elements of an array.
  var j, x, i;
  for (i = a.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    x = a[i];
    a[i] = a[j];
    a[j] = x;
  }
  return a;
}
{% endhighlight %}

In the **newBoard** function, add the following code to use our new function.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function newBoard() {
  // ... previous code ...

  // Select 25 words from the word list.
  var words = getWords(spreadsheet);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need to choose which team goes first. Enter this code at the bottom of **newBoard**.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function newBoard() {
  // ... previous code ...

  // Choose which team starts first.
  var color_box = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('color_box');
  var colors;
  if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
    color_box.setBackground('#ff9999');
    colors = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('red_starts').getValues();
  } else {
    color_box.setBackground('#ccccff');
    colors = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('blue_starts').getValues();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We set the color box to light red or light blue depending on who starts. Then we choose which set of colors to use.

At this point the colors are all in order. We need to randomize the order so that the board layout is different each time. Let’s use our `shuffle` function to do that.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function newBoard() {
  // ... previous code ...

  // Shuffle the list of colors so the board is randomized.
  colors = shuffle(colors);
}
{% endhighlight %}

We need to actually put the words and colors in the cells! Let’s create a function that does that.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function prepareCells(codemaster_range, player_range, words, colors) {
  for (i=1; i<6; i++) {
    for (j=1; j<6; j++) {
      // Convert 2d index to 1d index.
      var idx = (i - 1) * 5 + (j - 1);
      
      // Codemaster board.
      var cell = codemaster_range.getCell(i, j);
      cell.setBackground(colors[idx]);
      cell.setValue(words[idx]);
      
      // Player board.
      cell = player_range.getCell(i, j);
      cell.setBackground('white');
      cell.setValue(words[idx]);
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This function has four parameters: the two boards, the selected words, and the randomized colors. The code is mostly self-explanatory, but one thing I will point out is that we explicitly set the player board’s cell backgrounds to `white`. Why? Although they are initially white, they will end up colored later as the teams guess which cells are theirs. So when we click the **New Game** button, we need to erase the previous game’s colors.

Let’s use the function in **newBoard**.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function newBoard() {
  // ... previous code ...

  // Color cells and enter the selected words.
  prepareCells(codemaster_range, player_range, words, colors);
}
{% endhighlight %}

The finished **newBoard** function should look like this.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function newBoard() {
  // Get references to the player and codemaster boards.
  var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var codemaster_range = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('codemaster_board');
  var player_range = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('player_board');
  
  // Select 25 words from the word list.
  var words = getWords(spreadsheet);
  
  // Choose which team starts first.
  var color_box = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('color_box');
  var colors;
  if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
    color_box.setBackground('#ff9999');
    colors = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('red_starts').getValues();
  } else {
    color_box.setBackground('#ccccff');
    colors = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('blue_starts').getValues();
  }
  
  // Shuffle the list of colors so the board is randomized.
  colors = shuffle(colors);
  
  // Color cells and enter the selected words.
  prepareCells(codemaster_range, player_range, words, colors);
}
{% endhighlight %}

The last bit of code will reveal the color of a selected cell on the main board.

First we’ll get a reference to the codemaster and player boards.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function revealSelectedCell() {
  // Get references to the player and codemaster boards.
  var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var codemaster_range = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('codemaster_board');
  var player_range = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('player_board');
}
{% endhighlight %}

We also need a reference to the entire **Main Board** sheet. This is because selected cells are a property of Sheets, not Ranges.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function revealSelectedCell() {
  // ... previous code ...

  // We also need a reference to the player sheet so that we can
  // access the selected cell.
  var player_sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName('Main Board');
  var selection = player_sheet.getActiveRange();
}
{% endhighlight %}

It’s possible the players clicked the reveal button without selecting a cell, in which case selection will equal null. We’ll want to display a message to the players in that case. It’s also possible they selected more than one cell, in which case we’ll assume the top-left cell is the one they wanted.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function revealSelectedCell() {
  // ... previous code ...

  // If no cell is selected return null, otherwise return the
  // top-left cell of the selected range (since multiple cells
  // may have been selected).
  var cell = (selection == null) ? null : selection.getCell(1, 1);
{% endhighlight %}

It’s also possible they selected a cell outside the 5x5 board (i.e. A1) in which case we should display a message to the players.

{% highlight js linenos %}
function revealSelectedCell() {
  // ... previous code ...

  // Verify the selected cell is on the player board.
  if (
    cell == null || 
    cell.getColumn() < player_range.getColumn() ||
    cell.getColumn() > player_range.getLastColumn() ||
    cell.getRow() < player_range.getRow() ||
    cell.getRow() > player_range.getLastRow()
  ) {
    // Show an error message, if necessary.
    Browser.msgBox('Select a cell from the board before clicking the reveal button.');
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

If they selected a valid cell, let’s find the matching cell on the codemaster board, get the color of the cell, and color the player board cell. To do this, add an `else` section to the if statement we just wrote.

{% highlight js linenos %}
  // ... previous code ...
  // if() {
  } else {
    // rowOffset is necessary because `cell` coords are wrt the 
    // whole sheet, while `master_cell` coords are wrt the named range.
    var rowOffset = -1;
    
    // Check the master board to see what color the cell is.
    var master_cell = codemaster_range.getCell(cell.getRow()+rowOffset, cell.getColumn());
    
    // Update the player board to show the color.
    var color = master_cell.getBackground();
    cell.setBackground(color);
  }
{% endhighlight %}

The code for the function should now look like this:

{% highlight js linenos %}
function revealSelectedCell() {
  // Get references to the player and codemaster boards.
  var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var codemaster_range = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('codemaster_board');
  var player_range = spreadsheet.getRangeByName('player_board');
  
  // We also need a reference to the player sheet so that we can
  // access the selected cell.
  var player_sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName('Main Board');
  var selection = player_sheet.getActiveRange();
  
  // If no cell is selected return null, otherwise return the
  // top-left cell of the selected range (since multiple cells
  // may have been selected).
  var cell = (selection == null) ? null : selection.getCell(1, 1);
  
  // Verify the selected cell is on the player board.
  if (
    cell == null || 
    cell.getColumn() < player_range.getColumn() ||
    cell.getColumn() > player_range.getLastColumn() ||
    cell.getRow() < player_range.getRow() ||
    cell.getRow() > player_range.getLastRow()
  ) {
    // Show an error message, if necessary.
    Browser.msgBox('Select a cell from the board before clicking the reveal button.');
  } else {
    // rowOffset is necessary because `cell` coords are wrt the 
    // whole sheet, while `master_cell` coords are wrt the named range.
    var rowOffset = -1;
    
    // Check the master board to see what color the cell is.
    var master_cell = codemaster_range.getCell(cell.getRow()+rowOffset, cell.getColumn());
    
    // Update the player board to show the color.
    var color = master_cell.getBackground();
    cell.setBackground(color);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Great! Next we'll make a very similar board the codemasters can use to give hints.
