This is Part 5 of the Codenames tutorial series. In this part, we're going to bring our buttons to life by connecting them to the game logic we programmed.

* Part 5 - Connecting UI elements to functions

All that’s left to do is connect our buttons to their respective functions!

Right-click the **New Game** button. Click the three dots in the top-right corner of the drawing. Choose **Assign script**. Enter `newBoard` and click **OK**.

Do the same for the **Reveal Selected Cell** button except we’ll assign the `revealSelectedCell` to it.

We’re done! Let’s test it out.

Try click the **New Game** a few times and make sure new words appear in both the codemaster and player boards. 

Make sure the colors are randomized each time as well. 

Select a cell in the player board and click the reveal button. Make sure the color matches what’s on the codemaster board. 

Try selecting cell **A1** and clicking the reveal button. The message box should appear.

All done!
