It's that time of year again when a lot of people are thinking about what they'd like to do differently next year.

But the truth is that you can make changes to your routine anytime throughout the year. Don't wait until January 1!

My 2019 goals were ambitious:
* record an EP,
* get to grade 4 piano, and
* finish developing a web app I had halfway completed. 

I spent the next several months dividing my attention between these three projects. I ended up setting them all aside when I realized I was spending too much time on solitary hobbies that were taking me away from my friends and family.

As I was going through my yearly reflection process over the 2019 Christmas holidays, there was a question I struggled to answer: "What were your biggest failures?"

While I did fail to complete my three goals, I failed because I realized my goals didn't align with my values. This was a valuable lesson for me. It helped me shape my 2020 goals and prioritize them in a way that aligns with my values.
